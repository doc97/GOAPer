# Week 5

The hour report can be found in the same folder as this document.

## Progress

- Wiki documentation
- Getting Started instructions
- JavaDoc comments
- Test coverage improved

I also researched how to implement my custom heap even though I did not have time to code it.
Even though I did not address the problem in the Console class this week, it will be done soon.
It was not a priority since it is just for demo and testing purposes. Building a robust terminal
interface comes in second after the custom data structures.

## Problems

The code review shed light on the fact that I might not have explained my project too well. I think
it lacks some concrete examples. This is where a graphical representation would be useful. Pictures
of the scenarios might also help.

The `AlgorithmUtils` class seems a bit clunky and I am not entirely sure how to address it. On one hand I
want to give no restrictions to anyone wanting to create their own algorithm, but at the same time limit
repeating myself (in code).

## Questions

- Is there anything lacking from the project? Any features that you'd like to see implemented the before the demo?

## Next week

- Refactor the Console
- Continuing on documentation
    - Extending and creating your own algorithms
    - How to model a problem (Example)
- Design and implement own data structures
    - Heap (min)
    - Implement solution to replace `System.arraycopy`
- Implement resource gathering / crafting scenario (re-occuring actions)

I will in the future try to add more functionality like editing the goal during runtime and otherwise improving the simulation.
