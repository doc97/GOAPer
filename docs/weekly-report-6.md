# Week 5

The hour report can be found in the same folder as this document.

## Progress

- Heap (min)
- Replaced `System.arraycopy`
- Resource gathering / crafting scenario
- Testing & implementation documentation

Adding the resource gathering scenario required me to change the heuristic model of the HeapAlgorithm which turned
out to be very challenging. Many hours worth of code had to be trashed before landing on the current solution.

## Problems

## Questions

## Next week

I will try to fix the simulation and UI part of the project so that it might be possible for a friend to demo
my project. I will also start using my custom data structures and throw away all `java.util` data structures.
